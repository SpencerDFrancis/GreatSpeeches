                    People of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
                    For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship,
                    I even found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are
                    ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to
                    proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it is the
                    Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.
                    And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather,
                    he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
                    From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth;
                    and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of
                    their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach
                    out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us. "For
                    in him we live and move and have our being." As some of your own poets
                    have said, "We are his offspring." Therefore since we are God's offspring,
                    we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or
                    stone—an image made by human design and skill. In the past God
                    overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere
                    to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with
                    justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this
                    to everyone by raising him from the dead.
