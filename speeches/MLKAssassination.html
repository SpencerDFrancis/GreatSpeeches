                    I have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that
                    Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight.<br><br>
                    
                    Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that
                    effort.<br><br>
                    
                    In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we
                    are and what direction we want to move in. For those of you who are black--considering the evidence there evidently is
                    that there were white people who were responsible--you can be filled with bitterness, with hatred, and a desire for
                    revenge. We can move in that direction as a country, in great polarization--black people amongst black, white people
                    amongst white, filled with hatred toward one another.<br><br>
                    
                    Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand and to comprehend, and to replace that violence, that
                    stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand with compassion and love.<br><br>
                    
                    For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act,
                    against all white people, I can only say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my
                    family killed, but he was killed by a white man. But we have to make an effort in the United States, we have to make an
                    effort to understand, to go beyond these rather difficult times.<br><br>
                    
                    My favorite poet was Aeschylus. He wrote: “In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart
                    until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.”<br><br>
                    
                    What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the
                    United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of
                    justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black.<br><br>
                    
                    So I shall ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King, that's true, but more
                    importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love--a prayer for understanding and that compassion of
                    which I spoke.<br><br>
                    
                    We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times; we've had difficult times in the past; we will have
                    difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; it is not the end of
                    disorder.<br><br>
                    
                    But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together,
                    want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings who abide in our land.<br><br>
                    
                    Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the
                    life of this world.<br><br>
                    
                    Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.<br><br>
