                <p class="prose">
                    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent,
                    a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
                    all men are created equal.<br><br>
                    
                    Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
                    any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
                    great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
                    field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that
                    that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
                    do this.<br><br>
                    
                    But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we
                    can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
                    here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The
                    world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never
                    forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated
                    here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
                    advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
                    before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that
                    cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here
                    highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this
                    nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government
                    of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
