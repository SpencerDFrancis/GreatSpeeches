                <p class="prose">
                    Athenians, I see how extremely spiritual you are in every way. For as I went
                    through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found
                    among them an altar with the inscription,<br><br>
                    
                    "To an unknown god."<br><br>
                    
                    What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and
                    everything in it, he who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines
                    made by human hands, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed
                    anything, since he himself gives to all mortals life and breath and all things.
                    From one ancestor he made all peoples to inhabit the whole earth, and he
                    allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where
                    they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps fumble about
                    for him and find himâ€”though indeed he is not far from each one of us. For
                    "In him we live and move and have our being"; as even some of your own poets
                    have said, "For we, too, are his offspring." <br><br>
                    
                    Since we are God's offspring, we ought not to think that the deity is like gold or silver or stone, an image
                    formed by the art and imagination of mortals. While God has overlooked the
                    times of human ignorance, now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
                    because he has fixed a day on which he will have the world judged in
                    righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given
                    assurance to all by raising him from the dead.
