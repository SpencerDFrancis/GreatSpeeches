                <h3>The Beatitudes</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>
                    Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br><br>
                    Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.<br><br>
                    Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.<br><br>
                    Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.<br><br>
                    Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.<br><br>
                    Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br><br>
                    Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>
                    Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely
                    on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted
                    the prophets who were before you.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Salt and Light</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste,
                    how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything
                    but is thrown out and trampled under foot. You are the light of the
                    world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid. People do not light a
                    lamp and put it under the bushel basket; rather, they put it on
                    the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same
                    way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your
                    good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.
                </p>

                <h3>The Law and the Prophets</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets;
                    I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you,
                    until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke
                    of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.
                    Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
                    and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the
                    kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will
                    be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless
                    your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees,
                    you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
                </p>
        
                <h3>Concerning Anger</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You
                    shall not murder,' and 'whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.'
                    But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother or sister,
                    you will be liable to judgment, and if you insult a brother or
                    sister, you will be liable to the council, and if you say,
                    'You fool,' you will be liable to the hell of fire. So when you
                    are offering your gift at the altar, if you remember that your
                    brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there
                    before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother or
                    sister, and then come and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly
                    with your accuser while you are on the way to court with him, or
                    your accuser may hand you over to the judge and the judge to the
                    guard, and you will be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you
                    will never get out until you have paid the last penny.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Adultery</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
                    But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has
                    already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right
                    eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better
                    for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be
                    thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it
                    off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your
                    members than for your whole body to go into hell.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Divorce</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a
                    certificate of divorce.' But I say to you that anyone who divorces his
                    wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, causes her to commit
                    adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Oaths</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Again, you have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You
                    shall not swear falsely, but carry out the vows you have made to the Lord.'
                    But I say to you: Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the
                    throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by
                    Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. And do not swear by your
                    head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. Let your word be 'Yes,
                    Yes' or 'No, No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Retaliation</h3>
                <p clas="prose">
                    You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a
                    tooth.' But I say to you: Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone
                    strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also, and if anyone
                    wants to sue you and take your shirt, give your coat as well, and if
                    anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. Give to the
                    one who asks of you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.
                </p>


                <h3>Love for Enemies</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate
                    your enemy.' But I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who
                    persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven, for
                    he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the
                    righteous and on the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you,
                    what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
                    And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing
                    than others? Do not even the gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore,
                    as your heavenly Father is perfect.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Almsgiving</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Beware of practicing your righteousness before others in order to be seen
                    by them, for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven. So whenever
                    you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the
                    synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly
                    I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not
                    let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may
                    be done in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Prayer</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand
                    and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be
                    seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever
                    you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in
                    secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. When you are
                    praying, do not heap up empty phrases as the gentiles do, for they think that
                    they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your
                    Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray, then, in this way:
                </p>
                <p class="poetry">
                    Our Father in heaven,
                        may your name be revered as holy.
                        May your kingdom come.
                        May your will be done
                        on earth as it is in heaven.

                    Give us today our daily bread.
                        And forgive us our debts,
                        as we also have forgiven our debtors.
                        And do not bring us to the time of trial,
                        but rescue us from the evil one.
                </p>
                <p class="prose">
                    For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
                    but if you do not forgive others, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Fasting</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    And whenever you fast, do not look somber, like the hypocrites, for they mark their faces
                    to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
                    But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may be
                    seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret
                    will reward you.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Treasures</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where
                    thieves break in and steal, but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
                    moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure
                    is, there your heart will be also.
                </p>

                <h3>The Eye</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of
                    light, but if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If, then,
                    the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
                </p>

                <h3>Serving Two Masters</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    No one can serve two masters, for a slave will either hate the one and love the other or be
                    devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
                </p>

                <h3>Do Not Worry</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink,
                    or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than
                    clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns,
                    and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of
                    you by worrying can add a single hour to your span of life? And why do you worry aboutclothing?
                    Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you,
                    even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. But if God so clothes the
                    grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not
                    much more clothe you—you of little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?'
                    or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?' For it is the gentiles who seek all these things,
                    and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom
                    of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. So do not worry
                    about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today's trouble is enough for today.
                </p>

                <h3>Judging Others</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For the judgment you give will be the judgment you
                    get, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's
                    eye but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, 'Let me take the
                    speck out of your eye,' while the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of
                    your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.
                </p>

                <h3>Profaning the Holy</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample
                    them under foot and turn and maul you.
                </p>

                <h3>Ask, Search, Knock</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened
                    for you. For everyone who asks receives, and everyone who searches finds, and for everyone who
                    knocks, the door will be opened. Is there anyone among you who, if your child asked for bread,
                    would give a stone? Or if the child asked for a fish, would give a snake? If you, then, who are
                    evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give
                    good things to those who ask him!
                </p>

                <h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    In everything do to others as you would have them do to you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
                </p>

                <h3>The Narrow Gate</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction,
                    and there are many who take it. For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life,
                    and there are few who find it.
                </p>

                <h3>A Tree and Its Fruit</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
                    You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns or figs from thistles? In the
                    same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot
                    bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will
                    be cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.
                </p>

                <h3>Concerning Self-Deception</h3>
                <p class="prose">
                    Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who
                    does the will of my Father in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
                    prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
                    Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; go away from me, you who behave lawlessly.'

                    Everyone, then, who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built
                    his house on rock. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but
                    it did not fall because it had been founded on rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine
                    and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain fell,
                    and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was
                    its fall!
