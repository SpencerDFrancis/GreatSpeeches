                <p class="poetry">
                    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
                    I come to bury <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar,</a> not to praise him.
                    The evil that men do lives after them; 
                    The good is oft interrèd with their bones.
                    So let it be with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar.</a> The noble <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a>
                    Hath told you <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> was ambitious.
                    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
                    And grievously hath <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> answered it.
                    Here, under leave of <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> and the rest
                    (For <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> is an honorable man;
                    So are they all, all honorable men),
                    Come I to speak in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar's</a> funeral.
                    He was my friend, faithful and just to me,
                    But <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> says he was ambitious,
                    And <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> is an honorable man.
                    He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
                    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
                    Did this in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> seem ambitious?
                    When that the poor have cried, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> hath wept;
                    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
                    Yet <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> says he was ambitious,
                    And <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> is an honorable man.
                    You all did see that on the <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercalia">Lupercal</a>
                    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
                    Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
                    Yet <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> says he was ambitious,
                    And sure he is an honorable man.
                    I speak not to disprove what <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> spoke,
                    But here I am to speak what I do know.
                    You all did love him once, not without cause.
                    What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for
                    him?—
                    O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
                    And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me;
                    My heart is in the coffin there with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar,</a>
                    And I must pause till it come back to me.

                    Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,
                    And none so poor to do him reverence.
                    O masters, if I were disposed to stir
                    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
                    I should do <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> wrong and Cassius wrong,

                    I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will.

                    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood—
                    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory
                    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
                    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
                    Unto their issue.

                    If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
                    You all do know this mantle. I remember
                    The first time ever <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> put it on.
                    'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent,
                    That day he overcame the Nervii.
                    Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.
                    See what a rent the envious Casca made.
                    Through this the well-belovèd <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> stabbed,
                    And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away,
                    Mark how the blood of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> followed it,
                    As rushing out of doors to be resolved
                    If <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> so unkindly knocked or no;
                    For <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a>, as you know, was <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar's</a> angel.
                    Judge, O you gods, how dearly <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> loved him!
                    This was the most unkindest cut of all.
                    For when the noble <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> saw him stab,
                    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
                    Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,
                    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
                    Even at the base of Pompey's statue
                    (Which all the while ran blood) great <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar</a> fell.
                    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
                    Then I and you and all of us fell down,
                    Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
                    O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
                    The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.
                    Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
                    Our <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar's</a> vesture wounded? Look you here,

                    Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
                    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
                    They that have done this deed are honorable.
                    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
                    That made them do it. They are wise and honorable
                    And will no doubt with reasons answer you.
                    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
                    I am no orator, as <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> is,
                    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man
                    That love my friend, and that they know full well
                    That gave me public leave to speak of him.
                    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
                    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech
                    To stir men's blood. I only speak right on.
                    I tell you that which you yourselves do know,
                    Show you sweet <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" class="outside">Caesar's</a> wounds, poor poor dumb
                    mouths,
                    And bid them speak for me. But were I <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a>,
                    And <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus">Brutus</a> <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony">Antony</a>, there were an <a target="_blank" class="outside" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Antony">Antony</a>
                    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue

                    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
